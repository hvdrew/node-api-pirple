# Node API Server
### No External Dependencies

This project's goal is to create a full RESTful API with nothing more than Node.js's built in API. Nothing will be used as a dependency other than (eventually) using Twillio to handle SMS notifications.

----------------------

This project was created while following along with Pirple's "Node Master Class" course. If you'd like to learn what Node can do without any of the dependencies we've come to rely on, check it out!
